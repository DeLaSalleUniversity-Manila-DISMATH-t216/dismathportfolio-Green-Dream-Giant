##WEEK 1:

  - Here we go, it's time to learn my DISMATH (again). 
  - Introductions are still introductions; nothing new, except I'm getting ready for it this time.
  - Luckily, it's my favorite teacher again, Mr. Melvin and that guy intrigues me, and he's quite jolly all the time.
  - I met Vin and Mel again. This time, I knew all too well who's the Knight and the Knave without remembering back then. 
  - I guess things may not look so dark for me after all.
  - Ah yes, the propositions and the truth tables. How many times do you see **p** and **q** in other Math subjects? Either way, these guys will save me a couple of times later on.
  - Oh, and don't forget the connectives as well: ¬ for Negation, ∧ for **and**, ∨ for **or**,⊕ for  **xor**, → for **conditional** and ↔ for **biconditional**.
  - I need to learn all of these; they will save my life.

##WEEK 2:

  - I need to understand and practice using logical equivalences because they are very tricky, and unless I understand them completely, I need to memorize the key concepts.
  - I can simplify a logical statement using logical equivalences, as an alternative to the Truth table approach, but the problem is, the shortcut is not always the shortcut, mind you. 
  - By the way, I did the Superman homework thing in class in fifteen minutes! Although I have miss some codes, I think I got it right, and I kind of made sure of that. (Note: Superman does not exist!)
  - The quantifiers are next in my list that I really need to focus on right now, and these guys are quite hard and confusing, and if I don't understand their principles, I'm going to have a bad time! Hehehe...
  - **I find the implication most confusing, especially when the expression is no longer "if p, then q"** . He's right about that one that he wrote onto the example READme file, because that is what I need to watch out for.
  - My professor said that if I've read the book just this week, I'm in danger. 
  - I don't think I am that much in danger, because I have read and practice some problems, but still, I have to be extremely cautious.

##WEEK 3:

COMING SOON!
